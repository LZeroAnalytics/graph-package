  Graph Node
  ==========
  This Kurtosis package instantiates a Graph Node environment with PostgreSQL database and IPFS node for indexing and querying blockchain data through GraphQL APIs.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - Access to an Ethereum node with RPC endpoints
  - Subgraph definitions to deploy (optional)

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - `ethereum_args`: Ethereum configuration parameters for connecting to nodes
  - `network_type`: Network type, defaults to "bloctopus"
  - `rpc_url`: Optional custom RPC URL to connect to (if not using ethereum_args)
  - `env`: Environment setting, defaults to "main"
  
  The package automatically configures resource limits for the components:
  - PostgreSQL: CPU (10-1000) and memory (32-1024MB)
  - Graph Node: Connects to Ethereum, PostgreSQL, and IPFS services
  - IPFS: Provides storage for subgraph definitions
